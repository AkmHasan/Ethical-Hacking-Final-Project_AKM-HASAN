# Ethical-Hacking-Final-Project_AKM-HASAN
The project I have been completed by the following structure:  

 Reconnaissance and target analysis,
 Penetration (describing in detail the steps I have taken, tools I used),
 Maintaining my presence,
 Recommendations (how to make the target machines secure - this was addressed all vulnerabilities which I have identified in my assessment, not just the ones I have exploited),
 Conclusions (this should contain the evaluation of my work and also described some alternative approaches I could have taken).

The project Supervisor was Dr. Christo Panchev, Course Director of Cyber Security at Coventry University.
